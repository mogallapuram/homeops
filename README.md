# üè° HomeOps

**HomeOps** is my personal homelab project ‚Äî an evolving setup designed to **build and manage a full-featured K3s cluster at home** using open-source technologies.  
This repository documents **every step**, including setup notes, known issues, architecture diagrams, and troubleshooting logs.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of HomeOps is to create a **self-hosted, production-style environment** that mirrors real-world DevOps and cloud-native workflows ‚Äî but entirely on-premises.

### ‚ú® Objectives
- Build and maintain a **K3s cluster** on home infrastructure.  
- Use **100% open-source tools** for deployment, monitoring, and automation.  
- Document **every step** ‚Äî including errors, fixes, and lessons learned.  
- Keep it modular and reproducible using **Ansible**, **Helm**, and **Kubernetes manifests**.
